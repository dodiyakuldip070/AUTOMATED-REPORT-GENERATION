# DESCRIPTION:

This Python script generates a PDF report from a CSV file using the pandas and FPDF libraries. The script reads a dataset from a CSV file, calculates summary statistics for numerical columns (mean, median, and standard deviation), and displays a preview of the first five rows. It then formats this information into a structured PDF report.

The script uses pandas to handle data operations such as reading the CSV file and computing statistics. FPDF is used for PDF generation, allowing the creation of formatted text with different fonts and alignments. The report includes a title, summary statistics, and a data preview formatted in a readable way.

Technologies used:

Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
pandas: For data manipulation and analysis
FPDF: To create PDF documents
File Handling: Reads data from a CSV file
Error Handling: Uses a try-except block to catch errors
The script is structured with a main function that reads the CSV file and calls generate_pdf_report(), which processes the data and formats it into a PDF. The generated PDF provides a concise summary of the dataset, making it useful for data analysis and reporting.
